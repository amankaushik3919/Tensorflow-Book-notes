# Chapter 1 
> ### Intro To ML
ML: When a machine do something for which it is not programmed it is machine learning.

The First Computer based on Perceptrons.
# History of Perceptron

1. In 1905 Ramon y Cajal Studied Chicken brain tissue later called the neuron.

2. 1943 Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts devised a mathematical model for the neuron.
First Artificial Neuron.
Works Done by neuron:
Common Boolean `AND` and `OR` operations.

3. A psychologist, Frank Rosenblatt developen model for neruron that expanded on the work of McCulloch and Pitts. Model called Perceptrons.
By adding multiple layers of perceptrons first became to known as neural networks.

4. Now Mark 1 created in 1958

5. 1969 Marvin minsky and seymour papert published a book `Perceptrons`(MIT Press). Mathematically prooved Pereceptrons work done by Rosenblatt. (2-layer-feed-forward nn, inability to learn non-linear functions or implement the XOR).

# Steady Progress
- 1965 -> Ivakhnenko and lapa shows multilayer perceptrons with `non linear activation functions`.

- 1973 -> Paul Webos used backpropagation to train a neural network.

- 1980 -> Kunihiko Fukushima proposed the `neocognitron`, a multiayer neural network for image recognition.

- 1982 -> John Hopfiel Developed a type of `RNN` known as the Hopfiel Network.

- 1986 -> Sejnowski and Rosenberg developed NETTalk, a nn that learned how to say words.

# The Computer Revolution
- 1990s -> Now the improved semiconductors. Research Harnessed this power to execute ml routines. Now implemented ml for real world problems

- Cnn was developed for image recognition inspired by Fukushima's neocognitron.

- 1994 -> `Yann LeCun` First time demonstrated handwriting recognition with CNN  based `LeNet5` architecture.

# Problem
- Code sharability issue.
- 1990s -> data insufficiency.

# The Rise of Big Data and Deep learning
- Big data revolution: from the start of 21'st century the internet skyrocketed and data became sufficient. Now, the data is generated every second.

# Corporates issue
- How could they use their wealth of data to create wealth for their corporations? One major priority was advertising.
- 2006: Netflix intiative to release the large part of their database. Announced an offer of 1 million dollars to whoever developed the best recommendation engine.
- Winner BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, combined a number of ml algorithms to improve Nerflix's algorithm by 10%.
- Google Adsense used ml for finding which advertisements to display on its search engine.
- Google and Tesla Demonstrated self-driving cars used ml to follow roads and join traffic.
- Now the term `Deep learning` invented.
